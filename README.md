# TheThingsNetwork LoraWAN gateway with RAK831 and RaspberryPi Zero W for outdoor use with 5.5dB colinear antenna

To boost the growth of cost-effective community established outdoor gateways we have designed IRNAS outdoor LoraWAN gateway that includes all components and an antenna element in a weatherproof enclosure. This way communities can easily deploy good quality gateways with minimal costs.
IRNAS outdoor LoraWAN gateway joins great solutions into an unified gateway:

 * RAK wireless RAK831 gateway module http://www.rakwireless.com/en/WisKeyOSH/RAK831
 * Raspberry Pi Zero W embedded computer + SD card https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/
 * RAK-Raspberry Pi shield by ch2i https://github.com/hallard/RAK831-Zero
 * USB-Ethernet adapter and Waterproof PoE injector https://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-5-Pin-Micro-USB-2-0-To-RJ45-LAN-Ethernet-Network-Adapter-100Mbps-For/32789232255.html
 * DIY 5.5dB co-linear antenna designed by Fabien Ferrero from UNICE in France
 * Polyethilene tubing for enclosure 75mm diameter
 * 3D printed part by IRNAS to mount everything together

The final product is a simple and and cost-effective gateway for about 250 EUR anyone can make and simply install outdoor. With this design we have achieved over 50 km coverage between Pohorje mountain and cities of Graz in Austria and Zagreb in Croatia.


## Assembly instructions
Assembly instructions are coming up shortly, however the posted images are sufficient for replicating the design. The only custom mechanical part that can be 3D printed or milled available in this repository in the folder: mount and on [this link](https://a360.co/2HcsiBF).

## Co-linear antenna wire
Bending the wire for the co-linear 5.5dB antenna is likely the most challenging part and requires special care. Note that the frequency is tuned with the diameter of the loop and thus it must be made rather precisely.

Step-by-step instructions coming up shortly.
